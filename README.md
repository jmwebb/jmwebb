I'm a Senior Data Scientist at [Dray Alliance](https://www.drayalliance.com/home/) where I wrangle and analyze data to drive efficiency and growth.

I am passionate about technology that moves the analog world. Autonomy, robotics, supply chain. I'm a generalist who loves learning new technologies and learning how to learn.
